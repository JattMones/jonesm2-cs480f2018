### Matt Jones' 480 final project

**Existing work**
The work I am furthering comes from a practical done in an Allegheny CS102 course. It uses the python language to read pixels from a picture.

**My extension**
 I'm interested in picking out pixels that are the same color and adjacent to each other in order to pick out objects within the picture. Specifically, I'm interested in doing this so that a program can recognize a picture of a musical staff (eventually, a program could take this picture and write it electronically)
